# Bulk 2.0 API

The `bulk` package is an implementation of `Salesforce APIs` centered on `Bulk 2.0` operations.  These operations include:
* Creating a job
* Upload job data
* Close or Abort a job
* Delete a job
* Get all jobs
* Get job info
* Get job successful records
* Get job failed records
* Get job unprocessed records

As a reference, see `Salesforce API` [documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/intro_what_is_rest_api.htm)
